# TrashTech - Waste Classifier Project 🌍♻️

## Introduction 📝
TrashTech is a Flask-based project that aims to classify different categories of waste using deep learning techniques. The project has been trained on a dataset containing more than 5000 images of waste items. It not only classifies the waste into seven different categories but also provides sections to craft waste items and promote their reuse. The ultimate goal of TrashTech is to motivate people to recycle waste and raise awareness about the importance of recycling for the well-being of our planet. 🌱🌎

## Waste Classification ♻️🗑️
TrashTech utilizes deep learning algorithms to accurately classify waste items into the following seven categories:
1. Plastic 🥤
2. Glass 🍶
3. Metal 🧱
4. Paper 📄
5. Cardboard 📦
6. Organic 🥕
7. Miscellaneous 📦❔

The trained model is capable of analyzing images of waste items and predicting their corresponding category with high accuracy.

## Craft and Reuse ♻️🎨
TrashTech goes beyond waste classification by providing sections that offer creative ideas and instructions for crafting waste items into useful and aesthetically pleasing objects. These ideas encourage users to reuse waste materials and reduce their environmental impact. By transforming waste into valuable items, TrashTech aims to inspire users to think innovatively and contribute to a more sustainable future. ♻️🔨🖌️

## Motivation for Recycling Waste 🌍💪
Recycling waste plays a crucial role in preserving our planet's resources and protecting the environment. TrashTech emphasizes the significance of recycling by highlighting the potential consequences if we neglect this responsibility. Earth would suffer from the following consequences without proper waste recycling:
- Depletion of natural resources 🌳🏭
- Increased pollution and landfills 🏞️🗑️
- Destruction of ecosystems and wildlife habitats 🐦🐢🐝
- Climate change and global warming 🌡️🌍

By raising awareness about these issues, TrashTech encourages individuals to adopt sustainable practices and actively participate in recycling efforts.
